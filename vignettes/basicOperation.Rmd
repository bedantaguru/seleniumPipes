to illustrate the basic operations/functions in the package.


## Introduction

WebDriver is a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents. It provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behaviour of web browsers. 

`seleniumPipes` implements the [w3c specification](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html) for 
webdrivers.
